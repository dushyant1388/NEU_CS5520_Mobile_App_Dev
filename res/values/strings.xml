    <string name="wordgame_acks">1. The basic structure of this game is based on \'Letris 2\' game on Android.\r\n\r\n
        						2. Sudoku game in \'Hello Android\' book has been used as a reference for 2D graphics, storing state and other game settings.\r\n\r\n

    <string name="wordgame_instructions_ok_label">OK</string>
    <string name="wordgame_instructions">1. The game starts with the bottom row pre-populated with letters.\r\n\r\n
        								2. A new letter appears on the screen at regular time intervals depending on the difficulty level.\r\n\r\n
        								3. User has to click/tap on individual letters to form a word in that sequence, which is shown below the board of letters.\r\n\r\n
        								4. If the word formed by the user is valid, the word turns green. User should click/tap this word to confirm it.\r\n
        								    This will increase the score by that words length and the corresponding letters will disappear from the board.\r\n\r\n
        								5.If the word formed by the user is invalid, the word turns red. User should click/tap the \'Clear\' button to clear the selection of letters.\r\n\r\n
        								6. User needs to complete as many valid words as possible before the board is completely filled with letters.\r\n\r\n
        								7. The number of points earned for each valid word is equal to the length of that word. \r\n
        								    At the end of game, users can see their total score, longest word\'s length and accuracy.\r\n\r\n
        								8. User can change the difficulty level, no. of rows and no. of columns from the settings button shown on the menu screen.\r\n\r\n
        								9. User can pause or resume the game at any moment using the \'Pause\'/\'Resume\' button.\r\n\r\n
        								10. When the board is close to getting completely filled, users can hear a count down sound to notify them about the last few seconds remaining.\r\n</string>
    <string name="wordgame_hints_title">Hints</string>
    <string name="wordgame_hints_ok_label">OK</string>
    <string name="wordgame_hints">1. Never settle for one word. Almost every word on your game board can be added to. For example, the word AGE can be turned into AGED by adding a D. \r\n\r\n
        						2. It is worth waiting for a four letter scoring opportunity to come up rather than zooming through the level with three letter words and blitzing the objectives.\r\n\r\n
        						3. When time is running out, quickly complete as many 3 letter words as possible.\r\n</string>
